/*
Given an array A of size N. Print all the numbers less than K in the array.
The numbers should be such that the difference between every adjacent digit should be 1.

        Note: Print '-1' if no number if valid.

        Input:
        The first line consists of an integer T i.e number of test cases.
         T testcases follow. Each testcase contains two lines of input.
         The first line consists of two integers N and K separated by a space.
          The next line consists of N spaced integers.

        Output:
        For each testcase, print the required output.

        Constraints:
        1 <= T <= 100
        1 <= N <= 107
        1 <= K, A[i] <= 1018

        Example:
        Input:
        2
        8 54
        7 98 56 43 45 23 12 8
        10 1000
        87 89 45 235 465 765 123 987 499 655

        Output:
        43 45 23 12
        87 89 45 765 123 987

        Explanation:
        Testcase1: 43 45 23 12  all these numbers have adjacent digits diff as 1 and they are less than 54
